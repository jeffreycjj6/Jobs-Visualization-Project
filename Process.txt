First started wtih creating the actual web applciation through Python's flask library
Then had to register the webpages that would be generated from that and supply their html renders
The first renders were of the data obtained from the kaggle cleaning
Then added an SVG map of the USA and used CSS styling to make it interactable for every single state
    Ran into a few problems involving being able to hover and highlight borders
Next is to generate a page for each individual state that will showcase its aggregate data and all of its job listings
    This can be done by making variable parameters for the state html that displays a dataset of only the <<state>> in question
    Images could be done in a similar way
    Hopefully will also be able to map out each individual location of a job based on its city in that state
    Basically write code that will generate state.html rather than create a unique page for all states individually
Finally make the site more pretty by adding effects and designs
